**Why `static` in `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>`?**
- When running **parallel tests**, each test thread should have its own **separate WebDriver instance**.
- `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>` helps by **assigning a unique WebDriver to each thread**.
- **Making it `static` ensures that all test methods across different classes share the same `ThreadLocal` instance**, avoiding conflicts.

---

**What if We Remove `static`?**
If we **remove `static`**, each test class will have its own separate `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>`.

ðŸš« **This is a problem because:**
1. **Each test class instance will create a new `ThreadLocal`** instead of sharing one across threads.
2. **WebDriver instances may not be managed properly** in parallel execution, leading to errors.

---

**Correct Approach: Keep `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>` Static**
```java
public class DriverManager {
    private static ThreadLocal<WebDriver> driverThreadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();

    public static void setDriver(WebDriver driver) {
        driverThreadLocal.set(driver);
    }

    public static WebDriver getDriver() {
        return driverThreadLocal.get();
    }

    public static void removeDriver() {
        driverThreadLocal.remove();
    }
}
```

âœ… **With `static`:**
- **Only one `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>` exists for all test threads.**
- **Each test thread still gets its own WebDriver instance, avoiding conflicts.**

ðŸš€ **Final Answer:**
âœ” **If you want proper parallel execution, keep `ThreadLocal<WebDriver>` `static`.**
âœ” **Removing `static` will break parallel test execution.**
