here I have one doubt why using pageFactor ? and why cant we use directly By class?  -->

Why Use PageFactory?
PageFactory is a class in Selenium that initializes WebElements inside a Page Object Model (POM) class. It helps reduce boilerplate code and improves readability.

PageFactory initializes WebElements only when needed (lazy loading), reducing unnecessary findElement() calls and making code cleaner in Page Object Model (POM).

Using By directly requires calling findElement() every time, making the code less efficient and harder to maintain.

✅ Use PageFactory in POM for better readability and performance.
✅ Use By when elements are dynamic and cannot be pre-initialized.
